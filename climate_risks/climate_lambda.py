st.write("""

The climate finance literature employ characteristic-sorted portfolio to investigate the relationship between climate risks and cross-sectional stock returns.
Reasoning in terms of portfolio,
         the fundamental debate in the literature is to understand whether climate change risk dynamics 
            are rewarded or unrewarded in the cross-section of stock returns.

Some studies found the evidence of a carbon premium in the cross-section.
         However, it reamins unclear which transition risk can better explain the carbon premium.
         Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021) found that portfolios sorted on the total level and the 
         year-by-year change in emissions were valued at discount. These facts 
         are true regardless of the type of scope emission analysed. Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021)
         further showed that the carbon premium is not linked ot the emission intensity measure.

         The findings of Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021) are echoed by 
         Bolton and Kacperzcyk (2020) at the international level, although not all countries 
         are pricing cabron risk to the same extent. 
         On the other hand, Hsy $\textit{et al.} (2020)$ discovered that 
         the carbon premium is related to the emission intensity measure.
         Nevertheless, these findings were not corroborated by the remaining studies in the Table.
