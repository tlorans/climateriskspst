st.title('Climate Risks and the Cross Section of Stock Returns')


st.write(r"""
Two main currents characterise the literatuer 
on climate finance. The first relates 
to climate change science and the related risks. 
The second describes the financial implications
         for asset pricing.

Climate change risks can be divided into physical and transition risks 
(Carney, 2015). Physical risks refer to the negative impact 
of climate and weather-related events on company operations or society 
         (Tankov and Tantet, 2019). 
We traditionaly think of these risks as two types:
         (i) acute physical risks, that are related 
         to extreme weather events, and (ii) chronic physical risks,
         that are related to long-term shifts in climate patterns or sea-level rise.

On the other hand, transition risks refer to all 
         possible scenarios coherent with a path to a low-carbon 
         economy and all related implications for fossil fuels 
         and dependent sectors (Curtin $\textit{et al.}$, 2019).

In this course, we will focus on transition risks,
and discuss how their dynamics matter for asset pricing.

With respect to the financial side, climate finance 
         literature can be divided according to the type 
         of financial risks and asset considered.
In this course, we will focus on the impact on equity.
